Evolve information engines to get better at extracting work from correlated bit strings

# Results
This evolutionary algorithm uncovered new fundamental limits in the physics of information processing. Please see https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.042115 for details. Researchers studying the properties of embeddable and non-embeddable reversible random matrices may find this code useful.
